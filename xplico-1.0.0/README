Usage
-----
We describe here only console-mode modality, if you use Web interface then you have to see INSTALL 
and with root permision run /opt/xplico/script/sqlite_demo.sh.

Xplico in console-mode permit you to decode a single pcap file, directory of pcap files or decode in 
realtime from an ethernet interface (eth0, eth1, ...).
To select the input type you have to use -m option. The '-m' option permit you to load a particular 
xplico capture interface (capture-module).
The possible capture interfaces are 'pcap' and 'rltm'. If you run "./xplico -h -m pcap" you have an 
help of use of pcap interface, obviously "./xplico -h -m rltm' give you an help to use realtime interface.
In console-mode all file extracted by xplico are placed in 'tmp/xplico/' direcory, every protocol has 
a particular directory, and inside this direcory you can find the decoding data.
For example:
 - if you have to decode test.pcap, you have to launch this command:
       ./xplico  -m pcap -f test.pcap
   at the end of decoding your files are in xdecode/ip/http, xdecode/ip/pop, xdecode/ip/smtp, ...
   and kml file (Google Earth) is in xdecode/ip/

 - if you have to decode a direcotry "/tmp/test" where inside there are many pcap files you have
   to launch this command:
       ./xplico  -m pcap -d /tmp/test
   at the end of decoding your files are in xdecode/ip/http, xdecode/ip/pop, xdecode/ip/smtp, ...
   and kml file (Google Earth) is in xdecode/ip/

 - if you have to decode eth0 in realtime the command is:
       ./xplico  -m rltm -i eth0
   to break acquisition: ^C. At the end of decoding (decoding is in realtime) your files are in xdecode/ip/http,
   xdecode/ip/pop, xdecode/ip/smtp, ...
   and kml file (Google Earth) is in xdecode/

Xplico has many decoding modules, these modules are in 'modules' directory, to enable or disable 
a module you have to modify the xplico.cfg file (by default in ./config/ directory)
The GeoMap file (kml) for Google Earth is updated every 30 sec.

./xplico -g give you a graph of relations between the dissectors.
